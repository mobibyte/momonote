# Lesson 5 Notes

## Learning Objectives
1. **Explain how autotrophs & heterotrophs obtain their energy.**  
    Autotrophs (“self feeders”) are organisms that CAN build their own energy-rich macromolecules  
    • Photoautotrophs (like plants) use the energy of light to do this  
    • Chemoautotrophs (like some bacteria) use the energy of inorganic molecules (like sulfur or ammonia)  
2. **Write the overall chemical equation for photosynthesis.**  
    Energy + 6CO2 + 6H2O => C6H12O6 + 6O2  

3. **Identify which reaction words (anabolic / catabolic, endergonic / exergonic) accurately
describe photosynthesis.**  
  Photosynthesis is an **anabolic** process. Anabolic processes build complex molecules from simpler ones. In photosynthesis, simple molecules of water and carbon dioxide are assembled into glucose, a complex sugar, along with the production of oxygen. This synthesis of glucose involves the formation of new chemical bonds, demonstrating the constructive nature of anabolism.  
  
    Photosynthesis is an **endergonic** process. This means it requires an input of energy to proceed. The energy needed for photosynthesis comes from sunlight. In photosynthesis, light energy is captured by chlorophyll and used to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2). The process stores energy in the chemical bonds of glucose, a form of potential energy that is higher than the energy of the reactants. Therefore, the reaction is non-spontaneous without the input of energy.  

4. **Identify the source of energy for photosynthesis.**  
The source of energy for photosynthesis is sunlight.  

5. **Name the locations of the light reactions & the Calvin Cycle in a plant cell.**  
The light-dependent reactions occur in photosystems that are embedded in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts.  

    The Calvin Cycle (a.k.a. light-independent reactions) occurs in the stroma of chloroplasts.  

6. **Describe the general functions of the light reactions & the Calvin Cycle in photosynthesis.**  
        The light reactions capture light energy from the sun and convert it into chemical energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced form). These reactions take place in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. Water molecules (H2O) are split into oxygen (O2), protons (H+), and electrons (e-). This process releases oxygen as a byproduct into the atmosphere. The movement of electrons through the electron transport chain in the thylakoid membrane creates a proton gradient across the membrane. ATP is synthesized as protons flow back across the membrane through ATP synthase, utilizing the energy stored in the gradient. The ATP and NADPH produced in the light reactions provide the energy and reducing power, respectively, needed for the synthesis of carbohydrates in the next phase of photosynthesis, the Calvin Cycle.  
    
    The Calvin Cycle incorporates atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) into organic molecules, a process known as carbon fixation. This is the first step in forming glucose from CO2 and H2O. Using the ATP and NADPH generated during the light reactions, the Calvin Cycle chemically reduces the fixed carbon to produce the sugar G3P (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate). Two molecules of G3P can be combined to form glucose or other carbohydrates. The cycle also regenerates ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), the molecule that accepts CO2 in the first step of the cycle, allowing the process to continue.  

7. **Explain how the wavelength of light relates to its color & energy level.**  
    The color of an object (like a leaf) is determined by which wavelengths of light are reflected off its surface
    
    Light energy is made of photons that travel in waves
        • Light with shorter wavelengths (like blue & purple) has more energy  
        • Light with longer wavelengths (like red) has less energy  

8. **Explain why plants are green.**  
    To capture as much light as possible, plants use multiple pigment proteins that each absorb different wavelengths of light  
    Chlorophyll a is the primary pigment protein in plants. Accessory pigments (like Chlorophyll b & β-carotene) absorb light & transfer that energy to Chlorophyll a  
    Chlorophyll absorbs light most efficiently in the blue and red parts of the visible spectrum and reflects green light. This reflected green light is what gives plants their green color.  

9. **Name the structures that are found in a photosystem.**  
    Photosystems are complex structures found in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts in plants and in the membranes of cyanobacteria. They play a crucial role in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis by capturing light energy and converting it into chemical energy. A photosystem consists of several key components:  
        Light-Harvesting Complex: This consists of hundreds of pigment molecules, including chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b (in plants), and various carotenoids. These pigments are structured to efficiently capture light of various wavelengths and funnel the energy towards the reaction center.  
        Reaction Center: At the core of a photosystem is the reaction center, which contains a special pair of chlorophyll a molecules. Once the Light-Harvesting complex absorbs light energy and transfers it to the reaction center, the energy excites electrons in these chlorophyll molecules to a higher energy state.  
        Primary Electron Acceptor: This molecule is located very close to the reaction center chlorophylls. It captures the high-energy electrons from the excited chlorophyll a molecules before they can return to their ground state. This step is crucial for the subsequent electron transport chain.  
        Core Complex: The core complex includes proteins that bind the reaction center, the primary electron acceptor, and other components together. It ensures the proper alignment and functioning of the photosystem.  
        Peripheral Proteins: These are various proteins attached to the photosystem that play roles in electron transport, proton translocation, and the stabilization of the complex.  

10. **Explain how photosystems trap light energy.**  
    Photosystems trap light energy through the following steps:  
    *Light Absorption:* Pigment molecules in the antenna complex absorb light of various wavelengths.  
    *Energy Transfer:* The absorbed light energy is transferred to a special chlorophyll a molecule in the reaction center.  
    *Electron Excitation:* This energy excites an electron in the chlorophyll a to a higher energy state.  
    *Electron Transport:* The excited electron is transferred to an electron acceptor, starting the electron transport chain, which generates ATP and NADPH.  
    In essence, photosystems capture light energy and convert it into chemical energy, crucial for the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis.    

11. **Identify the source of the excited electrons found in Photosystem II & Photosystem I.**  
    Each photosystem has a central reaction center with a Chlorophyll a molecule & a pair of special electrons   
    During the light reactions, all pigments in the photosystem collect light energy  
        • This energy is funneled toward the reaction center  
        • Ultimately, it energizes Chlorophyll a’s special electrons  
        • These energized special electrons then travel through Electron Transport Chain proteins and are ultimately donated to NAD+  

12. **Explain how the light reactions of photosynthesis generate oxygen.**  

13. **Describe how the proton (H +) gradient across the thylakoid membrane is generated.**  

14. **Explain how the H+ gradient is used to generate ATP.**  

15. **List the products & reactants of the light reactions.**  

16. **Explain the relationship between the products of photosynthesis’ light reactions & the
reactants of the Calvin cycle.**  

17. **Explain what happens in carbon fixation.**  

18. **Name the enzyme that performs carbon fixation.**  

19. **Explain why 6 turns of the cycle is necessary to make 1 glucose.**  

20. **Explain how photosynthesis & cellular respiration are related to one another.**
