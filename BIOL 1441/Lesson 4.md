# Lesson 4 Notes
## Learning Objectives
**1. Explain why the human body needs to eat.**  
On the most basic level, you need to eat to get the 
energy required to survive  
• Energy is required for building **macromolecules** (like 
proteins & nucleic acids)  
• Energy is required for life-sustaining processes like active 
transport

**2. Define the term “metabolism”**    
**Metabolism** is the sum of all the chemical reactions that 
occur in your cells to keep you alive  

**3. Describe the function of chemical bonds.**  
Foods store energy in their chemical bonds  
• By breaking those chemical bonds, that energy is released 
into your cells  
• Your cells can use that energy immediately or store it by 
forming new chemical bonds 

**4. Explain how the structure of ATP makes it
good for storing & releasing energy.**  
ATP = adenosine triphosphate  
• ATP has 3 phosphate groups, so it has A LOT of energy  
• ATP is made when the cell has extra energy  

**5. Explain what happens in catabolic &
anabolic reactions.**  
Catabolic reactions break large polymers into smaller monomers    
• These reactions release energy  

Anabolic reactions build large polymers from smaller monomers  
• These reactions require energy  

**6. Explain what happens in endergonic &
exergonic reactions.**  
Exergonic reactions release energy  
• This is because the products of the reactions 
have LESS energy than the reactants  

Endergonic reactions require energy  
• This is because the products of the reactions 
have MORE energy than the reactants

**7. Describe the relationship between
catabolic, anabolic, endergonic, and
exergonic reactions.**  
Catabolic & anabolic reactions are paired  
• The monomers made in catabolic reactions are used to build polymers in anabolic reactions  

Exergonic & endergonic reactions are paired  
• The energy released in exergonic reactions is used to power endergonic reactions  

**8. Explain how ATP & ADP are related.**  
ADP = adenosine diphosphate  
• ADP has 2 phosphate groups, so it has *some* energy  
• ADP is made when the cell uses the energy in ATP (by removing one of its phosphate groups)  

9. Explain what happens during redox
reactions.
10. Write the overall chemical equation for
cellular respiration.
11. Identify the location where each step of
cellular respiration occurs in the cell.
12. Differentiate between substrate-level
phosphorylation & chemiosmosis.
13. List the number of carbons found in
glucose & pyruvate.
14. Identify the starting materials & products
created by each of these processes:
glycolysis, pyruvate oxidation, the Citric
Acid Cycle (a.k.a. Krebs Cycle), and the
Electron Transport Chain (and oxidative
phosphorylation).
15. Explain the function of electron carriers
in cellular respiration.
16. Explain how electrons are used to build a
proton gradient across the inner
mitochondrial membrane.
17. Explain how the movement of protons is
used to build ATP.
18. Describe the role of oxygen in the
process of cellular respiration.
19. Describe the purpose of fermentation.
20. Explain how alcohol & lactic acid
fermentation occur, including types of
organisms using each pathway
21. Explain the role of feedback inhibition in
regulating cellular respiration.

## Slide Notes
In **cellular respiration** the energy is transferred to the bonds between the phosphate groups ATP.

**ATP** can be used by cells as a source of energy by breaking the high-energy phosphate bonds.

The energy in glucose is stored in the chemical bonds between the atoms. It is not directly available for your cells to use.

## Homework Answers 
The **Citric Acid Cycle** (Krebs Cycle) builds ATP through **substrate-level phosphorylation**

Glycolysis starts with **glucose** and ends with **pyruvate**

![ChemicalReaction](Flash%20Cards/assets/Lesson4.2.png)

In the chemical reaction above, Zn loses 2 electrons, transforming it into Zn^2+. This means that Zn was **oxidized** in this chemical reaction.


Pyruvate oxidation starts with **pyruvate**, and ends with **acetyl coenzyme A**

A chemical reaction that *builds* a large polymer from small monomers is called **an anabolic** reaction.
Because this *building* reaction requires energy, this kind of reaction would also be considered **endergonic**.

*Pyruvate* oxidation occurs **in the mitochondrial matrix**

O2 (Oxygen) required by the *mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain* **accepts low-energy electrons and forms water.**

**NAD+** electron carrier does **NOT** transport electrons
**NADH** electron carrier **DOES** transport electrons

**Fermentation** generates **more NAD+**

In a chemical reaction, the molecule that gets **reduced** will form a *new chemical bond* with the electrons it receives.
