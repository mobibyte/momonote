# Lesson 4 Notes
## Learning Objectives
1. **Explain why the human body needs to eat.**  
On the most basic level, you need to eat to get the 
energy required to survive  
• Energy is required for building **macromolecules** (like 
proteins & nucleic acids)  
• Energy is required for life-sustaining processes like active 
transport

2. **Define the term “metabolism”**    
**Metabolism** is the sum of all the chemical reactions that 
occur in your cells to keep you alive  

3. **Describe the function of chemical bonds.**  
Foods store energy in their chemical bonds  
• By breaking those chemical bonds, that energy is released 
into your cells  
• Your cells can use that energy immediately or store it by 
forming new chemical bonds 

4. **Explain how the structure of ATP makes it good for storing & releasing energy.**  
ATP = adenosine triphosphate  
• ATP has 3 phosphate groups, so it has A LOT of energy  
• ATP is made when the cell has extra energy  

5. **Explain what happens in catabolic & anabolic reactions.**  
Catabolic reactions break large polymers into smaller monomers    
• These reactions release energy  

Anabolic reactions build large polymers from smaller monomers  
• These reactions require energy  

6. **Explain what happens in endergonic & exergonic reactions.**  
Exergonic reactions release energy  
• This is because the products of the reactions 
have LESS energy than the reactants  

Endergonic reactions require energy  
• This is because the products of the reactions 
have MORE energy than the reactants

7. **Describe the relationship between catabolic, anabolic, endergonic, and exergonic reactions.**  
Catabolic & anabolic reactions are paired  
• The monomers made in catabolic reactions are used to build polymers in anabolic reactions  

Exergonic & endergonic reactions are paired  
• The energy released in exergonic reactions is used to power endergonic reactions  

8. **Explain how ATP & ADP are related.**  
ADP = adenosine diphosphate  
• ADP has 2 phosphate groups, so it has *some* energy  
• ADP is made when the cell uses the energy in ATP (by removing one of its phosphate groups)  

9. **Explain what happens during redox reactions.**   
Redox is a type of chemical reaction in which the oxidation states of a reactant change.   
Oxidation is the loss of electrons or an increase in the oxidation state.  
Reduction is the gain of electrons or a decrease in the oxidation state.  

10. **Write the overall chemical equation for cellular respiration.**  
C6H12O6 + 6O2 --> 6CO2 + 6H2O + 36 or 38 ATP  

11. **Identify the location where each step of cellular respiration occurs in the cell.**  
  Step 1: glycolysis - Splits the glucose into pyruvate molecules
  Glycolysis is the initial glucose-breaking process
  • Many chemical reactions break its chemical bonds, rearrange its elements, and harvest some of its energy
  Starting materials: glucose (C6H12O6) + 2 ATP + 2 NAD+ *Oxygen (O2) is NOT required for this process!*
  Ending materials: 2 pyruvate (C3H4O3) + 2 (net) ATP + 2 NADH
  • Technically, 4 ATP are made, but 2 ATP are required, so the cell only gains 2 ATP
  • This ATP is made through substrate-level phosphorylation
  Location: the cytoplasm
  Stored Forms of Energy: The energy from glucose is stored in the 2 ATPs (net gain) and 2 NADH produced.

  Step 2: pyruvate oxidation - Moves the pyruvates into the mitochondria & processes them
  Each 3-carbon pyruvate still has A LOT of energy
    • The pyruvates are transported into the mitochondria so that energy can be harvested
  Starting materials: 2 pyruvate + 2 NAD+ + 2 Coenzyme A complexes
  Ending materials: 2 acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA) + 2 CO2 + 2 NADH
  Location: the mitochondrial matrix (a.k.a. its center)
  Stored Forms of Energy: Energy is stored in the high-energy electrons of NADH.
  
  Step 3: the Citric Acid (Krebs) Cycle - Remove energy-rich electrons from the process pyruvates
  The Citric Acid Cycle harvests all the remaining energy in Acetyl Coenzyme A (Acetyl CoA)
    • REMEMBER: one glucose molecule makes two acetyl CoA’s!
  Starting materials: 2 acetyl CoA + 6 NAD+ + 2 FAD (+ oxaloacetate )
  Ending materials: oxaloacetate + 4 CO2 + 2 ATP + 6 NADH + 2 FADH2
  Location: the mitochondrial matrix (a.k.a. its center)
  Stored Forms of Energy: Energy is stored in the high-energy electrons of NADH and FADH2, and in the ATP produced.
  
  Step 4: oxidative phosphorylation - Use the energy from those high-energy electrons to build ATP 
  Oxidative phosphorylation is the only cellular respiration process that requires oxygen (O2)
  O2 is the final electron acceptor at the end of the Electron Transport Chain (ETC)
  • Energy-poor electrons are donated to O2, making space for other electrons to continue to move through the ETC
  • If oxygen was not present, electrons would build up in the Electron Transport Chain & electron carriers would remain permanently reduced
  Starting Materials: Electrons carried by NADH and FADH2, and Oxygen as the final electron acceptor
  Ending Materials: Water (from the reduction of oxygen) and approximately 36 ATP molecules (?)
  Location: Inner mitochondrial membrane
  Stored Forms of Energy: The energy is stored in the ATP produced. This stage harnesses the energy from an electrochemical gradient (proton gradient) across the inner mitochondrial membrane through chemiosmosis.

12. **Differentiate between substrate-level
phosphorylation & chemiosmosis.**  

13. **List the number of carbons found in
glucose & pyruvate.**  

14. **Identify the starting materials & products
created by each of these processes:
glycolysis, pyruvate oxidation, the Citric
Acid Cycle (a.k.a. Krebs Cycle), and the
Electron Transport Chain (and oxidative
phosphorylation).**  

15. **Explain the function of electron carriers
in cellular respiration.**  

16. **Explain how electrons are used to build a
proton gradient across the inner
mitochondrial membrane.**  

17. **Explain how the movement of protons is
used to build ATP.**  

18. **Describe the role of oxygen in the
process of cellular respiration.**  

19. **Describe the purpose of fermentation.**  

20. **Explain how alcohol & lactic acid
fermentation occur, including types of
organisms using each pathway**  

21. **Explain the role of feedback inhibition in
regulating cellular respiration.**  


## Slide Notes
In **cellular respiration** the energy is transferred to the bonds between the phosphate groups ATP.

**ATP** can be used by cells as a source of energy by breaking the high-energy phosphate bonds.

The energy in glucose is stored in the chemical bonds between the atoms. It is not directly available for your cells to use.

## Homework Answers 
The **Citric Acid Cycle** (Krebs Cycle) builds ATP through **substrate-level phosphorylation**

Glycolysis starts with **glucose** and ends with **pyruvate**

![ChemicalReaction](Flash%20Cards/assets/Lesson4.2.png)

In the chemical reaction above, Zn loses 2 electrons, transforming it into Zn^2+. This means that Zn was **oxidized** in this chemical reaction.


Pyruvate oxidation starts with **pyruvate**, and ends with **acetyl coenzyme A**

A chemical reaction that *builds* a large polymer from small monomers is called **an anabolic** reaction.
Because this *building* reaction requires energy, this kind of reaction would also be considered **endergonic**.

*Pyruvate* oxidation occurs **in the mitochondrial matrix**

O2 (Oxygen) required by the *mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain* **accepts low-energy electrons and forms water.**

**NAD+** electron carrier does **NOT** transport electrons
**NADH** electron carrier **DOES** transport electrons

**Fermentation** generates **more NAD+**

In a chemical reaction, the molecule that gets **reduced** will form a *new chemical bond* with the electrons it receives.
