notes

## Managing people

- managing people working as indiviuals and in groups

- people are an organizations most important assets
- like herding cats

## problem solving

- Requires the integration of differnt types of knowledge

- development of a model of the solution and testing of this model against the problem
- representation of this model in an appropriate notation or programming language

## Management activities

- Problem solving

- motivating
- planning
- estimating
- controlling
- organizing

## Motivation

- Motivation is compleex issue but it appears that there are different types of motivation based on:
  - basic needs (e.g. food, sleep, etc.)
  - personal needs (e.g. respect, self-esteem)
  - social needs (e.g. need to be accepted by group)

## Human needs hierarchy

- esteem needs (What i do is what i like to do)
- social needs (being accepted within a company, and recognizing people)
- safety needs (have to have job security e.g. will i have this job in 1 year?)
- physiological needs ($ amounts)

(humans are run by 2 emotions, greed and fear)

x-axis part

## Personality type

- the needs hiearchy is almost certainly an over simplifcation

3 types

- Task oriented
  - the motivation for doing the work is the work itself
- Self-oriented.
  - The work is a means to an end which is the achievement of individual goals - e.g. to get rich, to play tennis, to travel etc.
- Interaction-oriented
  - The principal motivation is the presence and actions of co-workers. People go to work because they like to go to work

good team is not a lot of good players

## Group working

- most software engineering is a group activity
  - the development schedule for most nontrival software projects is such that they cannot be completed by one person working alone

- group interaction is a key determinate of group performance
- Flexibility in group composition is limited
  - managers must do the best they can with available people

(anytime you get upset with someone, just dont say anything for 5 minutes)

## Group leadership

- leadership depends on respect not title or status

- there should be both a technical and a managerial leader
- a career path based on technical competence should be supported

( in SWE its looked down uppon when you go from manager to developer )

## Group comunication

- Essential to have good communication
- Information must be exchanged on the status of work, design decions and changes to previous decisions
- good communications also strengthens group cohesion as it promotes understanding

## group organization

- software engineering group size should be < 8 memebers

- break big projects down into multiple smaller projects
- small teams are more democratic
- Chief programmer teams try to make the most effective use of skills and experiences

## choosing & keeping people

- appointment decisions are usually based on
  - information provided by the candidate (their resume)
  - information gained at an interview
  - recommendations from other people who know the candidate

- Some comapnies use psychological or aptitude test
  - no agreement on whether or not these tests are actually useful

## working enviornments

- physical workplace provsions has an important effect on people

- comfort
- privacy
- facilities
- lighting heating
- furnature

## CML Capability Maturity model

- five stage model
  - inital: ad-hoc people management
  - repeatable: policies devleoped for cability improvement
  - defined: standaridized people management across org.
  - managed: quantitative goals for people
  - optimized: contiuous focus on improving individual competence and workforce motivation
