# Cloud Computing

## Topics covered

* By product of distributed systems
* What is cloud
* Could types
* Service models
* future

## Definition

* Cloud computing was inspired by the cloud symbol that is used to represent the network and internet diagrammatically.
* Cloud computing is a paradigm shift following the shift from mainframe to client-server in the 1980s

Cloud computing:

* Is internet-based computing
* where shared resources, software, and information are provided to compputers and other devices on DEMAND
* Like the electricity grid. That is you pay for the service as you need them
* (i.e. pay-for-what-you-use model)
  * sold on demand by minute/hr
  * a user can use as much or as little as wanted
  * service is fully managed by the provider

Cloud has to have 3 things (important)

* Internet based
* On demand
* Pay-for-service

## The cloud structure

Look at slides for picture

## Cloud computing term

* The term "Cloud computing" refers to both the cloud and also the services offered by the vendors;
* Such services provide:
  * Reliability: the large scale of the cloud brings resilience to downtime and improves availability;
  * Elasticity: can be easily sccaled up and / or down as an answer to demand;
  * Affordability: payment is flexible, based on flat rate, usage levels, pay per user, or a combination of these.

## Cloud types

* Public: delivery of resources and services through the internet. free or subsrctipion-based
* private: exclusive use by a single organization
* hybrid: Mix of the previous two. regualr workloads use of private cloud augmented by public loud resources when needed

## cloud service models

* Cloud computing is a general term for anything involves delievering hosted serivces over the internet

Types of service models: (important)

* Infastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)
* Platform-as-a-serivce (PaaS)
* Software-as-a-serivce (SaaS)

## Infastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)

* Delievers IT resources on demand, over the internet
* E.g. Amazon web services, Microsoft Azure, DigitalOcean

### Advantages ( know 1)

For the provider:

* Less dependency on a single or few customers
* Revenue is less volatile
* Consolodation of infastructure
* Easy to provide tranining to support teams.

For the user:

* Fast to setup
* no need to by manage
* just lease rent
* scales up and down well

### Disadvantages ( know 1)

For the provider:

* need to close consumption monitoring
* need to deal constantly with price shock
* fierce competition
* need to constantly devise differantion strats.

for the user:

* Need to deal with billing complexity
* privacy concerns
* lack of understanding how the infastructures work
* perforamnce may be affected by other users.

## Platform-as-a-serivce (PaaS)

* Similar to IaaS but in addition to computing it handles
  * Dev tools
  * middle ware
  * file sharing
* These resources and tools are enablers for dev testing and management

### Advantages (know 1)

For provider:

* Less dependency

for user:

### Disadvantages (know 1)

* Need to offer large varity
* customer needs to be heavy user
* carefully plan for migration

## Software-as-a-serivce (SaaS)

* Applications are hosted on vendors serveers

### Advantages (know 1)

* Increased profit
* software reach for more and most users
* decreased piracy
* Transparent software updates
* less liicense management
* less on premis IT infra
* lower upfront cost

### Disadvantages (know 1)

* difficult to provide with legacy software
* bigger worries about implementing security
* limited varity of application
* limited functionality when compared to traditonal application
* Connectivity requirement

## What lies ahead (IMPORTANT)

Hybrid cloud platforms:

* Big data
  * Large volumes of data that can be analyzed for insights that lead to better decisions and stategic business moves
  * Lots of data to reduce to little data
* Machine Learning
  * is an application of AI that provides systems the abiltiy to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicility programed
* Iot (internet of things)
  * system of interrrelated internet connected objects that are able to collect and transfer data over a wireless network without human intervention. the personal or buisness possiblties are endless
* Fog computing 
  * also called fog networking or fogging, describes decentrailized computing structure located between the cloud and deivces that produce data
