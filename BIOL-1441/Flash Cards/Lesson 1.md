**1. Explain the fundamentals of atomic structures and define a bond.**  

**2. Explain the main function of a cell’s plasma membrane.**  

**3. Describe the functions of phospholipids & transport proteins in the plasma membrane.**  

**4. Identify the hydrophobic & hydrophilic regions of the phospholipid bilayer.**

**5. List the kinds of molecules that can & cannot diffuse across the membrane.**  

**6. Use the chemical properties of a molecule (hydrophobic, hydrophilic, polar, nonpolar, charged) to determine whether or not it could diffuse across the membrane.**

**7. Explain what a concentration gradient is.**  

**8. Use the direction of a concentration gradient to determine which way a molecule would move (into or out of a cell).** 

**9. Explain how passive transport is different from active transport.**

**10.Explain why active transport is important to a cell.**  

**11.Identify similarities & differences between these transport processes: diffusion, facilitated diffusion, osmosis, primary active transport, secondary active transport.**
