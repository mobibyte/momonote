# flex Notes

flex generates a C (C++ compatible) lexical analyzer based on a description of the token patters to match and the code to execute when matches happen. It's a FOSS version of lex, developed separately from lex starting in about 1987 to get around the proprietary nature of lex and also to offer better performance.
> By the way, Eric Schmidt was co-author of the original lex program when he was an intern at Bell Labs back in 1975. He later became CEO of Google and (as of August 2023) was the 82rd richest person in the world. It's pretty clear therefore that compiler work can make one a billionaire so this class is totally worth it. :)

An analyzer generated by flex scans the incoming characters using a Deterministic Finite Automaton created from all of the Regular Expression patterns given in the original description. Thus, in general a flex generated lexical analyzer achieves O(n) time complexity on matching, where n is the number of characters in the input stream.
> NB. If one uses the REJECT capability of flex (a way to force the DFA to “try again” on a match that has already been made), greater than linear time complexity could result.

**A Note on Versions**

flex is remarkably stable — unlike a lot of crappy code that gets released nowadays.

Consequently, flex doesn't need to be released all that often as it does what it does quite well. Having said that, though, you should be using the most recent version 2.6.4 , released 2017- May-06 . That's more than six years ago so there's no excuse not to have it.

I have in the past received some questions from students re: warnings / errors from flex and in each case it's been because an older version of flex was being used. In one of the cases, a version from 2016-Mar-01 was being used, in another it was a version from before 2001-May-01 (?!?).

Everything in these Notes has been tested using flex 2.6.4 in two development environments, with different processor architectures and kernel versions,
